## Usage


## Versioning
Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 http://semver.org/

**Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:**   
MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,  
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and  
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.  
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

**FAQ**   
How should I deal with revisions in the 0.y.z initial development phase?  
>The simplest thing to do is start your initial development release at 0.1.0 and then increment the minor version for each subsequent release.

How do I know when to release 1.0.0?

>If your software is being used in production, it should probably already be 1.0.0. If you have a stable API on which users have come to depend, you should be 1.0.0. If you’re worrying a lot about backwards compatibility, you should probably already be 1.0.0.
